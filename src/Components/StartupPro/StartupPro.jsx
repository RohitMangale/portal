        <div className="stp-heading">From a Wholesale Coffee Distributor to an Upscale Agritourism Destination</div>



        <div className="stp-p">
          Heavenly Hawaiian began as a small green coffee wholesale operation in 1998 under different ownership. In 2017, we pivoted to a dynamic farm-to-cup experience with three revenue streams: on-farm retail sales, e-commerce sales, and a coffee club subscription service.

        <div className="stp-p">
          Similar to wine, specialty coffee is an artisanal beverage that is enhanced with greater education and sensory exploration. With this in mind, we implemented farm tours, roasting classes, brew workshops, coffee tastings, live coffee roasting, live art demonstrations, and a farm-side, boutique coffee bar.

        <div className="stp-heading">Rising Specialty Coffee and Agritourism Demand Combine for Massive Potential </div>



        <div className="stp-p">
          Heavenly Hawaiian’s coffee beans exceed the Specialty Coffee Association’s stringent quality requirements. The U.S. has the most developed specialty coffee market and specialty coffee has increased its market share from 1% to 25% over the last 20 years. Specialty coffee beverages represent 62% of all cups consumed in the past day, rising from 56% observed in January 2021(Please note that an account is required to access this source).

          Our on-site experiences resonate deeply with our guests, making Heavenly Hawaiian a prime example of a successful agritourism business.

        <div className="stp-p">
          Providing high-quality Kona Coffee will always be a core tenet of our farm, but Heavenly Hawaiian is more than just a coffee provider. Today, we create the ultimate coffee experience. Our mission is to ensure our customers feel like they are a part of our ‘Ohana’, the Hawaiian word for family.
        </div>


        <img className='stp-img1' src="https://d2j6gq8tvnyhoe.cloudfront.net/5358053b-ac69-4177-937d-7aedf17f29e8.jpg" alt="" />


        <div className="stp-p">
          The implementation of our Farmstay apprenticeship program is a unique key contributor to our business model. Qualified applicants from all over the world come to live and work on the farm, while learning about sustainable coffee farming, Hawaiian culture, and world-class customer service. Farmstay members perform field work, hold customer-facing roles as tour guides and baristas, and are the main drivers for forming genuine relationships with guests, making them feel like Ohana.
        </div>
        <div className="stp-p">
          Our field team and coffee harvesters are key members of our Ohana, earning starting wages more than twice the national minimum wage with an even higher earning potential during harvest. They preserve the health and cultural significance of the land by conducting tests of our volcanic soil and coffee leaf samples, carefully surveying extant and emerging threats.
